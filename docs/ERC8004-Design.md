# ERC-8004 Design (Deprecated)

This document described the legacy in-protocol ERC-8004 registry facets (Position NFT as registry).
That approach has been removed in favor of the canonical ERC-8004 Identity Registry + ERC-6551 TBAs
(see `.kiro/specs/erc6551-position-agents/`).

Do not implement or deploy the legacy facets under `src/erc8004/`.
